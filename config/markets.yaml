# Market mapping configuration
#
# This file defines how sports score events map to Kalshi alternate line markets.
# The Brain agent loads this at startup and uses it to build the ThresholdMap.
#
# Kalshi ticker format for totals (example):
#   KXNCAAB-25KENTST-TOTAL    <- NCAA Basketball game total
#   KXEPL-25MANCITY-TOTAL     <- Premier League game total
#   KXUCL-25REALMAD-TOTAL     <- Champions League game total
#
# The actual ticker suffix per alt-line is fetched from Kalshi's REST API at startup.
# This file provides the search patterns to find those markets.
