Fee-adjusted edge calculator.

When a score crosses a threshold, the "Over X" market's true probability is
effectively 100% — the event already happened. We're just racing to buy it
before the market reprices.

Edge = net payout - cost
     = (100 cents * (1 - fee_rate)) - yes_ask_cents

If edge >= min_edge_cents, the signal is worth firing.

Kalshi fee structure (as of 2024):
  - 7% fee on winnings only (not on stake)
  - Fee = 0.07 * (payout - cost) approximately, but since we assume ~100% win
    probability, fee ≈ 0.07 * (100 - yes_ask)
  - Net payout = 100 - yes_ask (profit) - fee_on_profit
  - = (100 - yes_ask) * (1 - 0.07) + ... but the simplest and most conservative
    model is: net = 100 * (1 - 0.07) - yes_ask = 93 - yes_ask
